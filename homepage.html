    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p>The TFM Forums are an ongoing project by lead developer @dead fish#5054. This build is just made as a prototype. If you want to donate to help keep us going, see the link at the bottom of the page.</p>
    <div>
    <h2>Whats new?</h2>
      <ul>-site organization improvements</ul>
      <ul>-rebuilt posting system; each post gets sent to postdata.html, and is then linked to demo_see.php. This is a faster system, that actually works. (unlike the last one) But, posts are not automatically shown quite yet.</ul>
      <ul>-New sign up/ login system. Again, this one actually works! (wow what a concept)</ul>
      <ul>-The topic / post selection things look better, with grids around the tables</ul>
      <ul>-Script.js was deleted, and streamlined into postmaker.html</ul>
      <ul>-No more example topics</ul>
      <ul>-Forums actually work now, and open in a pop-up window.</ul>
      <h4>Anyways,</h4>
